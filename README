This repository contains the perl source for all the programs in the
book Genomic Perl: From Bioinformatics Basics To Working Code,
Cambridge University Press, 2002.  This includes all the code on the
CD that accompanied the book, some of which did not appear in the
printed text.  The book is no longer in "print print", though
electronic versions can still be purchased through the publisher.  I
am releasing this code to the public domain.  The publisher does not
own any exclusive rights to the code.
